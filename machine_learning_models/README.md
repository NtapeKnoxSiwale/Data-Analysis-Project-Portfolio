# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains some machine learning learning models created using python from scratch.

## 1. [K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)](./K_Nearest_Neighbours/)

Given a data point `x`, we calculate it's distance from all data points in the dataset. Getting the closest k points where in **Regression**: Getting the average of their values while in **Classification**: Getting the label with the majority votes.
