This repo goes with [The video](https://youtu.be/eMOA1pPVUc4) on "Solving real world data science videos with Python Pandas!".

In this Analysis we work with a Sales Analysis dataset to ask the following Questions:

1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city had the highest number of sales?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
4. What products are often sold together?
