# Data Science Project Portfolio

This data science project portfolio repository showcases a collection of data science projects that I have completed The projects demonstrate a range of data science skills, including data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, statistical modeling, machine learning, and more.

Each project typically includes a description of the problem being addressed, the dataset being used, the techniques and algorithms applied, and the insights gained from the analysis. The repository may also include additional resources, such as code examples, tutorials, and instructional materials, to help others learn and apply the techniques used in the projects.

## 1. [Sales Data Analysis Notebook](./sales_analysis/sales_analysis_2019.ipynb)

This project used Python's pandas library to analyze sales data and answer several questions related to sales trends. The analysis focused on determining the best month for sales and the corresponding earnings, identifying the city with the highest number of sales, determining the optimal time for displaying advertisements, identifying frequently sold products, and determining the top-selling product and the reasons for its success. By answering these questions, the analysis aimed to provide valuable insights for improving sales and increasing revenue.

## 2. [Covid-19 Global Analysis using SQL and Tableau](./covid_19_global_analysis/README.md)

This project involved performing data cleaning on a COVID-19 global dataset using SQL, followed by creating a visualization of the data in Tableau. The cleaned dataset was used to analyze and understand trends in the spread of COVID-19 across the world.

## 3. [Data Cleaning With SQL](./nasheville_housing_data_cleaning/README.md)

This project involves cleaning a Nashville housing dataset with the goal of preparing it for analysis of the housing market. The data cleaning steps taken include filling in missing property addresses, splitting address columns, standardizing values in one of the columns, removing duplicates, and deleting unused columns. The cleaned dataset can now be used for further analysis or shared with other researchers.

## 4. [Machine Learning Models](./machine_learning_models/README.md)

This project involves building several machine learning models from scratch using Python. The objective of the project is to gain a deeper understanding of how these models work by implementing them from the ground up. The models may include basic regression and classification models, as well as more complex models such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The project may also involve exploring different algorithms and techniques used for model training and validation. By building and testing these models from scratch, the project aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how machine learning algorithms work and how they can be applied to real-world problems.
